# MALib_V2
MALib dataset for third-party library (TPL) recommendation in mobile app development. This is a new version with 60,000+ apps and 725,502 TPL usage records.


[You may like to find the original MALib dataset here.](https://github.com/fio1982/MALib) This dataset contains 10000+ apps downloaded from Google Play and 160,000 TPL usage records extract from those apps via LibRadar.

In Version 2, we have extended the mobile apps to 60,000+ in total, and have manually inspected all the TPLs when extracting TPL usage records. Note that, LibRadar finds out the TPL usage through pattern comparison, therefore, the inspection can further improved the accuracy of our dataset.

For ease of use, we have omitted the lists of mobile apps and TPLs, only providing two files to present the app-library relationship, i.e., the TPL usage records, similar to that in the recommendation research field.
